# Dragon Slayer: Dark Souls Inspired Text RPG

## Brief Description
Text-based RPG where you escape Undead Asylum, slay "mods" (miniboss Hollows), collect items/Estus, and defeat the final Ancient Dragon boss. Mechanics mimic Dark Souls: turn-based combat with attack/roll/block/parry/estus, bonfire rests, souls/levels (basic), permadeath respawn.[web:16][file:2]

## How the Program Works
- *Navigation*: Move between rooms via commands (north/south/etc.).
- *Combat*: Choose actions each turn. RNG for dodges/parries. Enemies attack after.
- *Progress*: Defeat 3 mods at fog gate to unlock Dragon lair.
- *Win Condition*: Survive and kill Dragon after mods.
- Run python main.py (Python 3+).[web:11]

## Important Notes
- Single file: all code in main.py using only standard libs (random, time, os).
- No external deps: requirements.txt empty.
- Extensive: 5+ rooms, multiple enemies, full DS-style mechanics, ASCII-ready (clear_screen), balanced stats.
- Controls: Type actions precisely (lowercase OK).
- Student project for STEM-1A requirements.[file:2]
